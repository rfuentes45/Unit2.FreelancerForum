// first thing i did based on the guidelines from the workshop is make an array
// based on the user story 

const freelancers = [
    {Name: 'Alice', Occupation: 'Writer', StartingP: 30},
    {Name: 'Bob', Occupation: 'Teacher', StartingP: 50},
    {Name: 'Carol', Occupation: 'Programmer', StartingP: 70}
]

// USER FINDS A MESSAGE THAT DISPLAYS THE AVERAGE STARTING PRICE OF $40

//prompt('The starting price for all freelancers is $40')

//const freelance = document.createElement('table')

//const elements = document.querySelector(freelancers)
